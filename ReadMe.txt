There are 3 jupyter notebook files in total:

1. The 'DS2 MT2 Final.ipynb' is the notebook containing SVM, DT, RF and XGB

2. The 'Churn_Model_NN_1.ipynb' is the notebook containing the first neural network model.

3. The 'NN_Model_2.ipynb' is the notebook containing the second neural network model.

*** 
This is done because, I could not install tensorflow on my system.

Also since I cannot use it, file #2 and file #3 are written in google colab notebook instead of jupyter.
