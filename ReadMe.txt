There are 3 jupyter notebook files in total:

1. The 'DS2 MT2 Final.ipynb' is the notebook containing SVM, DT, RF and XGB

2. The 'Churn_Model_NN_1.ipynb' is the notebook containing the first neural network model.

3. The 'NN_Model_2.ipynb' is the notebook containing the second neural network model.

*** 
This is done because, I could not install tensorflow on my system.

Also since I cannot use it, file #2 and file #3 are written in google colab notebook instead of jupyter.   


Customer retention is a top priority for many companies. Acquiring more customers can be more 
expensive than retaining customers. A churn model can be a tool that brings these elements 
together and provides insights and outputs that drive decision making across the organization.

Churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customer cancellations within a period, by 
the number of active customers at the start of the same period. This can be used to predict 
new products behavior within a short amount of time or target a particular audience. The output
of a churn model is to predict for the given circumstances, if the customer will not cancel or 
cancel the services provided by the organization.

In Machine Learning, this is a classic example of ‘Classification problem’. We can either use 
machine learning algorithms or use neural networks.
